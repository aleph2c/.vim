This plugin is like :agdo but it works recursively under a directory (or
multiple diectories).  The limitation for :argdo is that it does not glob
the files inside the subdiectories.  DirDo works in a similar manner but
you'e allowed to specify multiple directories (good for refactoring code
and modifying files in a deep hiearchy).  DirDo also globs the files in
the subdiectories so you can make sure an operation is performed
consistantly.
