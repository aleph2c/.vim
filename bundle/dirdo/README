This plugin is like :argdo but it works recursively under a directory (or
multiple directories).  The limitation for :argdo is that it does not glob
the files inside the subdirectories.  DirDo works in a similar manner but
you're allowed to specify multiple directories (good for refactoring code
and modifying files in a deep hierarchy).  DirDo also globs the files in
the subdirectories so you can make sure an operation is performed
consistantly.
