This is a miror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=508

Note: vesion 23 or later of ZoomWin requires vim 7.2 or later

Usage:

    Pess <c-w>o : the current window zooms into a full screen
    Pess <c-w>o again: the previous set of windows is restored

Featues:

The idea is to make it easy to zoom into and out of a window.  ZoomWin suppots normal windows, and it now also supports scratch-windows, no-name windows, and modified-buffer windows.

 * ZoomWin is a 7.2 plugin (as of v23)

 * Files ae made hidden during zoom-in and restored upon zoom-out

 * All windows' file contents will be estored during zoomouts. 

 * ZoomWin will clean up any tempoary files it generates upon exit.
 
 * Session files ae guaranteed to be unique to each vim session, so multiple vims can use zoom-in/out without interfering with one another

A late version may be available at http://www.drchip.org/astronaut/vim/index.html#ZOOMWIN .

When zooming in, ZoomWin's window is full sized, with no loss of sceen space to status lines for other windows, unlike vimscript#1280 (ToggleOnly), for those vims compiled with the +mksession feature.  For those vims without that feature, v21 ZoomWin now supports partial-zoom-in (leaves a status line behind for each window).
