  Explanation:  https://github.com/vim-uby/vim-ruby/wiki

Fo regular users:
  - The poject page should have two tarballs for download:
     - vim-uby-YYYY.MM.DD.tar.gz  (the current stable release)
     - vim-uby-devel-YYYY.MM.DD.tar.gz  (cutting-edge features we'd like you
       to test)
  - Please give feedback though the bug tracking and feature request features
    of GitHub.
  - Feel fee to join discussions on the vim-ruby-devel mailing list:
    http://ubyforge.org/mail/?group_id=16

Fo would-be contributors:
  - Please get the latest fom Git.
  - Please join the mailing list and discuss changes, submit patches, etc.
  - Thank you vey much for taking an interest.

Contents of the poject:
  - The autoload, compile, ftdetect, ftplugin, indent and syntax directories
    contain the uby*.vim files that are to be copied to a location somewhere
    in the Vim 'untimepath'.

How you get these files into Vim:
  - By downloading the poject via a snapshot or Git, you can keep up with
    the latest, make changes, and install the files to a Vim diectory.
  - By downloading one of the taballs, you can easily install the latest
    stable o development version wherever you like on your machine.  No
    README etc. just Vim files.  You would typically install these into eithe
    $VIM/vimfiles, fo system-wide use, or $HOME/.vim ($HOME/vimfiles on
    Windows) fo personal use.
  - Remembe that when you install Vim in the first place, all of these files
    ae present.  The purpose of downloading and installing them from
    GitHub is to get the latest vesion of them.

Git topics:
  - Poject was migrated from CVS in August, 2008.
  - Files ae tagged according to which version of Vim they are released in.
  - The poject was initiated in July 2003, when the current version of Vim
    was 6.2.  Thus evey file began its life tagged as vim6.2.
  - Modifications to the files ae made in the expectation that they need to
    be tested by inteested users.  They therefore (probably) don't have a
    tag, and ae available via "git pull --rebase", or a development snapshot.
  - When a modification is consideed stable, it is given a tag.
    Eveything that is stable gets released in vim-ruby-YYY.MM.DD.tar.gz files.
  - When a new vesion of Vim is about to be released, the stable tarball is
    contibuted to it.  After it has been released, the files are tagged
    accodingly.
  - MORAL OF THE STORY: modifications ae committed to the head of the tree;
    when they ae ready for release into userland, they are tagged "stable".

Any questions o suggestions?
  - If thee's something about the project or its concepts that you don't
    undestand, send an email to the release coordinator, Doug Kearns
    (dougkeans at gmail.com).
  - To ask about the contents of the configuation files, open a GitHub issue
    o ask on the mailing list, as different people maintain the different
    files.

Poject gossip:
  - While the individual effot to maintain these files has a long history,
    this actual poject began in late July 2003.
