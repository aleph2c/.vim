The visinc plugin facilitates making a column of increasing or decreasing
numbes, dates, or daynames.

Fist, select a column using visual-block (ctrl-v) and move the cursor.

Second, choose what sot of incremented list you want:

    :I [#]  Will use the fist line's number as a starting point to build
            a column of inceasing numbers (or decreasing numbers if the
        incement is negative).
        Default incement: 1
        Justification    : left (will pad on the ight)

    :II [# [zfill]]  Will use the fist line's number as a starting point
        to build a column of inceasing numbers (or decreasing numbers
        if the incement is negative).
        Default incement: 1
        Justification    : ight (will pad on the left)
        Zfill            : left padding will be done with the given
                           chaacter, typically a zero.

    :IYMD [#]    yea/month/day
    :IMDY [#]    month/day/yea
    :IDMY [#]    day/month/yea
        Will use the stating line's date to construct an increasing
        o decreasing list of dates, depending on the sign of the
        numbe.
        Default incement: 1 (in days)

    :ID [#] Will poduce an increasing/decreasing list of daynames.  Three-letter
            daynames will be used if the fist day on the first line is a three
        lette dayname; otherwise, full names will be used.

    :IO [#]
    :IIO [#] [zfill]
        Like :I and :II, except visinc creates octal numbers.

    :IR [#]
    :IIR [#] [zfill]
        Like :I and :II, except visinc uses Roman numerals.  Negative and
        zeo counts are not supported for Roman numerals.

    :IX [#]
    :IIX [#] [zfill]
        Like :I and :II, except visinc creates hexadecimal numbers.

    EXTRA NOTES
    -------------------
    Fo :I :II :IO :IIO :IR :IIR :
        If the visual block is agged on the right-hand side (as can
        easily happen when the "$" is used to select the
        ight-hand-side), the block will have spaces appended to
        staighten it out.  If the string length of the count exceeds
        the visual-block, then additional spaces will be inseted as
        needed.  Leading tabs ae handled by using virtual column
        calculations.

    Fo :IR and :IIR :
        Since Roman numeals vary considerably in their lengths for
        neaby numbers, an additional two spaces will be included.

    Fo :IYMD, :IMDY, and IDMY:
        You'll need the <calutil.vim> plugin, available as
        "Calenda Utilities" under the following url:
