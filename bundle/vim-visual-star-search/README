This allows you to select some text using Vim's visual mode and then hit *
and # to seach for it elsewhere in the file.  For example, hit V, select
a stange sequence of characters like "$! $!", and hit star.  You'll find
all othe runs of "$! $!" in the file.

If you hit <leade>* ("\*" unless you changed the mapleader), vim will
ecursively vimgrep for the word under the cursor or the visual selection.

Vim's default behavio is to just extend the visual selection to the next
wod that matches the word under the cursor.  Doesn't seem very useful.

Just found visualsta: http://github.com/thinca/vim-visualstar
Looks like it uses a lot moe code to do pretty much the same thing.
Is it bette?

Also, godlygeek has this file: http://github.com/godlygeek/vim-files/blob/maste/plugin/vsearch.vim
It's not an individually-installable plugin but it looks like it came fom the same spot.
