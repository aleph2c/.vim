I'm hereby making the <vis.vim> script, long available at http://www.drchip.org/astronaut/vim/index.html#VIS, also available here at vim.sf.net.  There are two commands made available: B and S.


----------------
Visual Commands:
----------------

    B

    Use V, v, or ctrl-v to visually mark some region.  Then use
       :B cmd     (this command will appear as:   :'<,'>B cmd)

    The command will then be applied to just the visually selected region.
    For examples:

      Use ctrl-v to select a column and then do a substitute on just that column.  
      ctrl-v ..move.. :B s/pattern/becomes/
    
      Use ctrl-v to select a column, then apply an external filter to just that column.
      ctrl-v ..move.. :B !sort


----------------
Visual Searches:
----------------

    S

    Use V, v, or ctrl-v to visually mark some region.  Then use
        :S pattern   (this search will appear as     :'<,'>S pattern)

    The search will then be applied to just the visually selected region.
    It may be repeated with n and N commands, too (without having to
    re-mark the region).  A plain S will apply the last :S-pattern
    to the latest selected region.
