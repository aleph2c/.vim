  *Questions for $1*
  === Pre trouble-shooting questions ===
    * [ ] Do you have enough information?
    * [ ] Is your information organized?
    * [ ] Can you draw a diagram of the components and their interactions?
    * [ ] Do you need to write some code to make it easier to see?
    * [ ] Can you think of anyway to speed up your feedback cycle?

    * [ ] Is it a repair or a pioneering problem?  Did it work once before, or did it
          work somewhere else?  Yes: Repair, No: Pioneering.

  === Repair (Complexity increases exponentially) ===
    * [ ] Can you test the individual components to reduce complexity?
    * [ ] Can you exchange components?
    * [ ] Can you reduce the number of interactions?
    * [ ] Are you continuing event though you know that something you have previously
          tested isn't working?
    * [ ] Has a thing you have previously tested fooled you into thinking it works,
          when it doesn't work? (Never assume something is right before you have
          checked it twice)

  == Pioneering ==
    * [ ] Has someone else solved this before (search)? Can you turn this into a
          repair?
    * [ ] Do you have something to baseline from?
    * [ ] Looking under the problem, are you focused on the right goals?  Are you
          stuck on solving a hard problem, when there is an easy problem?
    * [ ] Do you understand how your existing system works?  If not, can you draw
          diagrams and describe how it works before you continue?
    * [ ] What don't you know that you need to know?
